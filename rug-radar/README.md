Live risk scoring for new pump.fun token launches on Solana, built from public
on-chain data only. Watches new launches, scores each one from a handful of
signals, and serves a small live feed page.

Status: data layer and one signal are built; the rest are in progress — see
`../TASK.md` for the plan and `../PROGRESS.md` for where things stand.

## Data layer

`src/rpc.ts` is a thin client for the public Solana JSON-RPC API
(`getTokenSupply`, `getTokenLargestAccounts`, `getAccountInfo`,
`getSignaturesForAddress`, `getTransaction`). It takes the RPC URL from env
and never touches keys. Tests mock `fetch` with recorded response fixtures —
no live calls.

`src/knownAccounts.ts` lists well-known Solana program addresses (token
program, associated token program, system program) that signals exclude
when looking at real holders.

## Signals

1. **Deployer history** — how many tokens this wallet launched before and how
   they ended. *(planned)*
2. **Bundled buys** — wallets funded from one source that bought in the first
   minutes. *(planned)*
3. **Holder concentration** — top 10 holder share, excluding the bonding
   curve and known program accounts. **Built:** `src/signals/holderConcentration.ts`
   (pure scoring function) + `src/data/holderConcentration.ts` (gathers the
   input via `rpc.ts`).
4. **Liquidity and migration status**. *(planned)*

Each signal lives in its own module under `src/signals/` with offline tests
using recorded sample data — no live network calls in tests. Data-gathering
helpers that call the RPC layer live in `src/data/`, kept separate from the
pure scoring logic so the scoring can be tested without any network mocking.

## Setup

Requires Node 20+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` if you want a different public RPC endpoint than the default
(`https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`). No API keys are needed or used.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev     # start the web feed with auto-reload
npm start        # start it once, no reload
```

Then open http://localhost:8787 (or your configured `PORT`).

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

Tests run offline against recorded sample data, not live RPC calls.

## Other scripts

```bash
npm run typecheck   # type-check without emitting
npm run build        # compile to dist/
```
